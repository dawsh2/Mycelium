Mycelium is a high-performance messaging and transport framework for distributed, actor-based microservices. It delivers predictable, microsecond-level latency and efficient inter-process communication, enabling real-time, low-latency applications like high-frequency trading, real-time multiplayer gaming and streaming analytics.

Key features:
  Lock-free, zero-copy message queues
  Multi-transport support (TCP, UDP, shared memory, RDMA)
  Actor-friendly message routing and delivery guarantees
  Backpressure and flow control for high-throughput systems
  Efficient bijective IDs for deterministic message routing and fast lookups
  Designed for modular microservices architecture with minimal overhead
