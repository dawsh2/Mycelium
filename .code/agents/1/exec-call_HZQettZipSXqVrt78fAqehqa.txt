/Users/daws/repos/mycelium/.code/agents/6151d356-ce43-4093-beee-dcbbc985b027/result.txt:407:I can use git to read the code, which is good. Now, I need to check the `polygon-terminal/src/lib.rs` file. My goal is to compare the boot scaffolding to see if there’s any duplication. It’s always helpful to verify how things are structured and ensure there's no unnecessary repetition in the code. Clarity in code is key! Let's dive into that comparison.

It seems like I might propose adding an ExecutionResult type later, but it's not necessary for this milestone. I also need to check the polygon-terminal service and its executor metrics file. It's important to keep writing that metrics file, and I’ll propose maintaining the same schema along with adding new fields.
