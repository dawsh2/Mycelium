I see - the session has security restrictions that prevent me from accessing directories outside of `/Users/daws/repos/mycelium`. 

To complete your task, you'll need to either:

1. **Start a new session** with the working directory set to `~/repos/bandit`
2. **Provide file paths or content** from the Bandit repository that you'd like me to analyze
3. **Copy relevant Bandit files** into the mycelium repository temporarily for analysis

Would you like me to:
- Provide guidance on what specific files to share from Bandit for analysis?
- Create a template analysis plan that you can apply once you switch to the Bandit directory?
- Or would you prefer to restart this session in the Bandit directory?

For reference, I can create a comprehensive checklist of what to look for in a code duplication assessment, which you could then execute in the Bandit repository.
